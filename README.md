# jus_for_laughs

Twitter bot to mirror Jokes from reddit and post it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jus_for_laughs).

To access Twitter API I have used Tweepy and to access Reddit API I have used PRAW.

The bot runs every two hours automatically, for this just set up a cron job.

Run the bot using `run.sh`.

You can contact me on [gitter](https://gitter.im/akshatkarani).
